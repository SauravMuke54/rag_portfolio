TITLE: Multi-Source Data Comparator

PROBLEM:
Comparing data across multiple sources was manual, slow, and error-prone.

SOLUTION:
Designed and developed a Python-based comparator framework that performs
column-level and key-based comparison across heterogeneous data sources.

TECH STACK:
Python, SQL, Airflow

IMPACT:
- Automated benchmarking process
- Reduced processing time by 60%
- Improved data accuracy and reliability

DETAILS:
The framework supports configurable keys, schema validation,
and is integrated into Airflow pipelines as a reusable library.
